# User tests

Elli has been extensively tested throughout its development in order combat bugs and unexpected behaviors. After each major commit made by a developer, the devloper in question is resposnbile to ensure that the Elli works as intended by following the below guidelines.

## Basic functionality

Elli's basic functionality is described here. Ensure that this functionality is sustained after every change to the codebase:

1. The user can log into Elli using Microsoft Azure.
1. The home page has three tabs: *Book*, for making a new booking; *My bookings*, for viewing *all* bookings made by the currently logged in user; and *Profile*, for viewing the currently logged in user, viewing FAQ and About-sections as well as logging out.

## Errors

Confirm the following:

1. Ensure that the application does not throw any errors during compilation or when the user interacts with the functionality you just implemented.

## Mockup

Confrim the following:

1. View the mockup by navigating to [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/MmB2vbpx66CMgE2ZpD2qWt/Mockup).
1. Confirm that the steps of the booking process in the app matches the intended process visualised in the mockup.
1. Confirm that the app's graphical interface uses Elli's predetermined visual identity. Again, see the mockup.
