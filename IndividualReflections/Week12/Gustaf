- What do I want to learn or understand better?
  - We have talked about making an app/desktop app using Flutter/Dart/Firebase. As such, I want to better learn these technologies. I have already looked
    into Dart a little, but I need to learn more. 

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  - I have worked with Scrum, UML and sequence diagrams before. As such, I can help my team with these things. I have also worked a bit with frontend
  development in Java, and so I can help with this too. 

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  - We have not really started working with Scrum yet. We did however participate in a couple of Scrum exercises. We have started setting up a workflow
    for the project using Confluence and Jira to support the Scrum process.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  - Being part of ongoing discussions, e.g. discussing project ideas.
