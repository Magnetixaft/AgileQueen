Personal reflections for Ole Fjeldså, week 12, 2022-03-25 

This week I had the flu. As a consequence of this I was asleep from sunday last week to and including wednesday this week.
I have not been able to participate in much of the teams work and this is reflected in the answers below.

- what do I want to learn or understand better?

	How the team wants to work, and what types of projects the team is most interested in doing.
	The set of tools the team want to use for the project.
	
	I have been sent the resources to catch up with the groups work over the weekend, starting next week strong.

- how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

	I have experience with object-oriented programming, UML diagrams and sequence diagrams.
	All useful skills for most software projects.

	I have worked with scrum earlier.

- what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

	We have not used scrum this week.

- what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

	none this week.
