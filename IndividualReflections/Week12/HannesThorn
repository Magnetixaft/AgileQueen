what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how to take a project in a large group of people from start to finnnish. To get experience of common problems that may occur and
how we can solve the problems. For now it seems like we are going to build an app which is really exciting becaause we learn how to build and publish an 
app. Skills that will be very usefull in the future. Furthermore I want to learn how to better work for a hopefully real customer and how to better
plan and make use of the limitied time that you have while working on a project. 


how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
My hope for this project is that we can form a tight and well oil machine working togheter. That we are incuding and make use of the each persons qualitys
by ensuaring that everybody feels that they can contribut and are appreciatied for their work. I am used to work as a manager and hope that some of 
the skills that I have learnt there can be usefull here to create a good enviroment to work in.   


what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
So far we havent been able to do to much yet but we have started to work on Jira and Confluence and we have set up rules and a structur for how we want
it to look.


what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I feel that I can contribution with my knowledge of technology and my ambitions that will help the team push forward.
