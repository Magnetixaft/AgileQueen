Individual reflection for Gustaf Johansson week 13.

- What do I want to learn or understand better?
  - Flutter/Dart/Firebase. We have talked about learning about these technologies for our nexst sprint next week. I also want to learn more about Scrum. 

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  - I have worked with Scrum, UML and sequence diagrams before. As such, I can help my team with these things. I have also worked a bit with frontend
  development in Java, and so I can help with this too. (Same as last week).

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  - This week we tried learning Scrum by dividing this week's deliveries in a Scrum way. We also did a slicing the cake exercise in class. 

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  - Discussing the project, writing the project description.
