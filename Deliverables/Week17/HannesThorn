- what do I want to learn or understand better?
Since the two last reflections I said that i wanted to learn and become efficent in using flutter both codewise and UI which I now think has come quite
a bit. But as previously stated its always possible to learn more and I am not yet as efficent as I would like to be. To continue going from A->B I
will continue to learn by using youtube, and searche litterature on the web. Doing diffrent small subtask and working on other diffrent projects in flutter.

- how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By continuing to learn new skills with both figma the UIX design and Flutter I can advice and disscuss diffrent solutions with the team.
Furthermore providing a safe space for everyone to ensure that everbody feels okay and that is okay to ask for help and also encourage disscussion so
that the project and team can evolve.

- what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
By attending the group meetings and contribute with diffrent ideas and new angles. Furthermore be adjusting the work load per week and better estimate 
how much time diffrent sprint objects will take. Working within the frame of scrum, being clear with which parts of the sprint that I will be working on
and how and also updated regularly. Furthermore by collaborating with the group to ensure that we set up good rimefreames and divide our sprint points in
a good fashion.

- what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I have focused on desingin our admin-web application in Figma. Starting and setting up the ground for the second part of our booking-app.
Editing on the mockup of both the app and the web aplication and contiuing to work on dynamic storage for users. By being present at our meetings
and finish my assainged tasks and stories during the sprint.
