- what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand the database structure better, even though this hasn't been within my working area so far, but it is
always good to understand how the whole system works. Also, i want to improve my scrum skills.

- how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help others to understand better how i have built the profile page during this week and how the new theme works.

- what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have worked from with Jira to make sure that all my tasks and subtasks have been completed. I also make sure to update the
status of a task so that my group members know what i am currently working on.

- what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have coded the profile page in Android Studio with Flutter. This includes list items such as Help, About App and Log Out.
I also added a "dark theme" to the app. The theme is chosen by being the same as the system.
