Individual reflection for Gustaf Johansson week 17.

- What do I want to learn or understand better?
  - Flutter/Dart/Firebase/databases in general. This sprint I primarily worked on connected the frontend to the database. In order to finalise this process, I need to better
  better understand how databases work. Especially seeing as I have never worked with databased before. 

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  - I have worked with Scrum, UML and sequence diagrams before. As such, I can help my team with these things. I have also worked a bit with frontend
  development in Java, and so I can help with this too. (Same as last week). As mentioned above, I dediciated this sprint to front end development in
  Flutter. Because of this, I have learned quite a bit about front end development in Flutter, and I could potentially help my team with this. 

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  - Wrote user stories with my team, wrote acceptance criteria, had meetings. This week we had two meetings with our client. One was dedicated to 
  discussing Azure sign in and databases, and the other was our weekly client meeting where we discuss this sprint's progress. 

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  - I dedicated this sprint to connecting the "my bookings" tab I made last sprint to our database. Further, since what I made last week was purely hard
  coded, I created constructors for all the classes I made, and wrote logic so that the "my bookings" tab actually looks like the hard coded version, but
  dynamic.
