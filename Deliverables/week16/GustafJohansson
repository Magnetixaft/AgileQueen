Individual reflection for Gustaf Johansson week 16.

- What do I want to learn or understand better?
  - Flutter/Dart/Firebase. I have worked with developing the front end of our app this sprint. Therefore, it has become apparent that I need to better
  learn Flutter. 

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  - I have worked with Scrum, UML and sequence diagrams before. As such, I can help my team with these things. I have also worked a bit with frontend
  development in Java, and so I can help with this too. (Same as last week). As mentioned above, I dediciated this sprint to front end development in
  Flutter. Because of this, I have learned quite a bit about front end development in Flutter, and I could potentially help my team with this. 

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  - Wrote user stories with my team, wrote acceptance criteria, had meetings. 

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  - This week I have primarily worked on developing the front end of the "my bookings" tab. It is almost finished,
  I just have to connect it to our backend. We have also written user stories.
