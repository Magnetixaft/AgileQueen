Personal reflections for Ole Fjeldså, week 16, 2022-04-22 


- what do I want to learn or understand better?

	Azure AD
	Firebase 
	
- how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

	After learning how to implement Azure AD properly, 
	I can help explaining it to the group and help with integrating the user information we get bacs so it works with firebase.

- what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	
	Added acceptance criteria to some user stories.
	
- what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

	Spent a lot of time finding out how to combine Azure AD with flutter as there is no built in support.
	Implemented Azure login with Johan Sandberg, still needs access to Elicit's Azure AD to start testing.
