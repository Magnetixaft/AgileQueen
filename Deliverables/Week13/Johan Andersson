- what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn Flutter, Firebase and other things to make those two deliver a functional experience

- how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I will help someone else or the entire group at any opportunities that I find. But I don't know which oppertunities will present themselves.  

- what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Not that much. We used the scrumboard for these week's deliverable. 
I pushed for an idea which can be realised early to demostrate value and then can be expanded a lot at the customer's request. 

- what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I worked with the idea and wrote part of the project description.
