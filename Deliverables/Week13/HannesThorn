Individual reflections should be submitted to your teams source code repository.


- what do I want to learn or understand better?
We havent had a meeting with a real cosutmer yet but I feel well prepared and I am still excisted about the meeting. Working with a large group so far 
has gone well and I am still learning more and more by each day. After the first meeting it will be more easy to set concrete exemple and goals
as we will know more of what is expected by us.

- how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have used Figma before and therefore have had the ability to help and guide both individual and for the entire team. I feel that we have formed a tight
group already where we have a open-minded atmosphere.

- what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Learing how to use Confluence & Jira better, startet the first TO-DO moved to in-progress and then it became the first finshied task under the set of rules
that wee choose for workin in Jira. Kind of test-sprint. Writing meeting-protocols.     

- what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I focused on doing the mockup on Figma. Set a perspective of the least value product.
