Individual reflections should be submitted to your teams source code repository.

- what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand better how to work with real customers, since we haven’t done that yet. This includes how they set requirements and how to conversation goes in general.

- how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have used most of our tools before as well as done a good portion of programming, especially in android studio. I have used user stories before. I have also used figma and xml for front end.

- what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Get more comfortable with using Jira & Confluence so that we can use this platform as efficiently as possible.

- what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I haven’t been able to attend our group meetings so I have joined through zoom to follow the discussion and come with new ideas.
