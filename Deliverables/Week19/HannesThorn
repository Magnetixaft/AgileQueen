- what do I want to learn or understand better?
This final week I would like to learn more about presentiation and to host meetings and presentations for a larger group.(since its only two days left 
until we have to send in the project its not enough time left to do so much more. I feel that I have learnt more about planning poker and flutter
since last week by reading litterature about it and by doing it.

- how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I feel like I have done before that making sure that everbody feels safe and motiviated I can help the team moving forward.  By counting to learn the 
promgramms that we use and how to work in a scrum way I can advice and disscuss diffrent solutions with the team. This week I have focused on 
making the app IOS compatible and there I have been aplle to help others set it up and work on the solutions around it.


- what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Firstly I have attend all the meetings, helping by discussing the diffrent tasks, and by playing planning poker. By clearly taking on tasks, assinge myself 
which stories I will do. Help with overviewing others members task and evalute the diffrent sprint task in the planning poker. Moving the cars in Jira 
from backlog to in progress to done.

- what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This sprint I have mainly focused on making our booking app IOS compatilble which it now is. So that we can pubilsh the app och appstore so that both 
apple and andriod users of our client can use the app. Thus finishing my assainged tasks and stories during the sprint and doing some of the last touches 
on the GUI analytics page for the admin-app.
