Individual reflection for Gustaf Johansson week 19.

- What do I want to learn or understand better?
  - The app is pretty mushc finished now, all that remains is fixing bugs and hopefully publishing the app on AppStore and Google Play. None of us 
  have any experience with publishing apps, and so I really want/need to learn how to do this. 

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  - I have worked with Scrum, UML and sequence diagrams before. As such, I can help my team with these things. At this point in the project I have also
  worked quite a bit with Flutter and its interaction with Firebase. I can therefore help my team members with this. 

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  - Wrote user stories with my team, wrote acceptance criteria, had meetings. During the sprint planning we did planning poker to estimate the time
  requirement for user stories. We had a meeting with our client this morning to show off the app, the meeting went well.  

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  This sprint I redesigned the entire booking GUI in the app. It took quite a while, but the end result came out very well. This new GUI implements some
  cool new functionality, too, like being able to book an entire day's worth of timeslots, and visualizing which timeslots are available in a pretty way. 
  I also fixed some other minor GUI related things such as adding the correct logo etc.
