Individual reflection for Gustaf Johansson week 18.

- What do I want to learn or understand better?
  - Flutter/Dart/Firebase/databases in general. Next sprint I will be working on both frontend and connecting the frontend to the database. I have a 
  feeling that the things I will be doing next sprint will be a little more complicated than the things I have already worked on. Therefore, I need to
  read up more on Flutter. 

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  - I have worked with Scrum, UML and sequence diagrams before. As such, I can help my team with these things. At this point in the project I have also
  worked quite a bit with Flutter and its interaction with Firebase. I can therefore help my team members with this. 

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  - Wrote user stories with my team, wrote acceptance criteria, had meetings. During the sprint planning we did planning poker to estimate the time
  requirement for user stories.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  - This sprint I was supposed to start working on the home page in the admin web page. However, due to some miscommunication, another team member started
  working on the same thing. We had a meeting about this, and we ended up combining our solutions. After this meeting I started refining the "my
  bookings" tab. Previously, the database had not properly been set up. Since Johan has started finishing the database structure, I was able to start
  connecting the database and the "my bookings" tab with function calls.
