Personal reflections for Ole Fjeldså, week 18, 2022-05-06 


- what do I want to learn or understand better?

	I would like a deeper understanding of how to connect the application to the database.	
	
- how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

	I can help build the connection between the admin page and firebase for the pages I designed.

- what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	
	Was scrum master this week. This week we started using planning poker to plan our velocity.
	It helped the group better decide on the scope of the different user stories.
	
- what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

	Implemented navigation for the admin application.
	Implemented Config page for the admin application.
	Some functionality dependent on the database is still missing for Config page.
