Personal reflections, Albert Wickman, week 18, 2022-05-06 


- what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn about how we should connect everything to the database.
	
- how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help with how the admin chooses a workspace to edit and how I have structured the drop down menu functions,
and how the rest of the functions work.

- what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have used Jira to make sure I have implemented everything that i was assigned to do.
Update my working status so that my group members know what I'm currently up to.


- what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have implemented the home page for the admin application using flutter.
Implemented drop down menus for choosing company, office and workspace.
Implemented the "cards" that show the specification of a workspace which the admin can edit.
