What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to hear what the other team members think they could do better when building their parts.
What would they change completely and what small tweaks could be made?

- how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Answer questions how the admin application works, as well as having good ideas regarding how we could
improve this in the future.

- what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have used Jira to see what people are up to and update others about my current status, especially
those who worked on the admin application.

- what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Implemented dynamic textinput fields for adding special equipment that belongs to a workspace.
Implemented deletion of the fields.
Added two static timeslot choices with chockboxes.
Added a dynamic custom timeslot section, built the same way as those for special equipment.
Fixed some design.
