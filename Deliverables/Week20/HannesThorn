I already have learnt durin this course have help a lot with structuring the project, planning and aslo easy overview for working togheter as a large group.
To learn more about the topics I have to contiune to read up on it, and keep myself updated.

For me during this whole course I fell like creating a safe enviroment has been my most important task to make it easier to learn, ask for help and
evolve as a team. Furthermore by studing and learning the diffrent programms that we use well so that I have a good knowledge in the diffrent applications.

- what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Firstly I have attend all the meetings, helping by discussing the diffrent tasks, and by playing planning poker. By clearly taking on tasks, assinge myself 
which stories I will do. Help with overviewing others members task and evalute the diffrent sprint task in the planning poker. Moving the cards in Jira 
from backlog to in progress to done so that the other team members easily can follow how my work is going.


- what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
